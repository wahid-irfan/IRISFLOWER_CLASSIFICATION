This Project is thorugh application of machine learning with python programming. It focuses on IRIS flower classification using Machine Learning with scikit tools. Here some of algorithm are used that are some types of machine learning subparts algorithms of supervised and Unsupervised learning. Algorithm used for predicting and get accuracy are -

Dicision tree classifier
K nearest classifier
SVM
Logistic Regression
metrics
train_test_split We are making accuracy and prediction in Iris project through Iris Dataset. This is easy and understable for machine learning staters( Naive ).
rish flower classification is a machine learning task that involves classifying images of Irish flowers into their respective species. This can be used for a variety of purposes, such as identifying invasive species, monitoring biodiversity, or simply learning more about the Irish flora.

There are a number of different machine learning algorithms that can be used for Irish flower classification. Some common algorithms include support vector machines (SVMs), random forests, and neural networks. The choice of algorithm will depend on a number of factors, such as the size and complexity of the dataset, the desired accuracy, and the computational resources available.

Once an algorithm has been chosen, the next step is to train the model on a dataset of images of Irish flowers. The dataset should be carefully curated to ensure that it is representative of the different species of Irish flowers. Once the model has been trained, it can be used to classify new images of Irish flowers.
